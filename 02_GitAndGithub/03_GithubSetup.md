#  What is GitHub?

* **GitHub** is a **remote repository hosting service** available on the internet.
* It works with **Git** (a Distributed Version Control System) to store and manage your projects online.
* GitHub allows you to:
  ✅ Host your code in **public or private repositories**.
  ✅ Collaborate with other developers.
  ✅ Track issues, manage projects, and contribute to open-source.
  ✅ Integrate CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions.

Think of Git as the **engine**, and GitHub as the **garage where you store and share your code**.
