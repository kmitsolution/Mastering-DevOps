* **Definition:** A **linear and sequential** approach to software development.
* **How it works:** You finish one phase completely before moving to the next (like a waterfall flowing down).
* **Phases:** Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
* **Pros:**

  * Simple and easy to manage.
  * Good for projects with fixed, clear requirements.
* **Cons:**

  * Hard to go back and change something.
  * Not flexible if customer needs evolve.
* **Example:** Building a **banking application** where requirements are strict and rarely change.

* **Definition:** An **iterative and incremental** approach to software development.
* **How it works:** Software is developed in **short cycles (called sprints)**, usually lasting 2–4 weeks. After each sprint, working software is delivered and reviewed.
* **Principles:**

  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  * Responding to change over following a fixed plan.
  * Deliver small, usable features frequently.
* **Pros:**

  * Very flexible, adapts to changes quickly.
  * Frequent customer feedback ensures the product meets expectations.
* **Cons:**

  * Requires continuous customer involvement.
  * Can be less predictable in cost and time.
* **Example:** Developing an **e-commerce website** where new features like product reviews, wishlist, and payment integrations can be added in separate sprints.

## 3️⃣ Lean Methodology

* **Definition:** A methodology inspired by **Lean Manufacturing ()**, focused on **efficiency and delivering value quickly**.
* **How it works:** Build only what’s necessary, avoid waste, and continuously improve.
* **Principles:**

  1. Eliminate waste (remove unnecessary work).
  2. Deliver fast.
  3. Empower teams to make decisions.
  4. Focus on customer value.
* **Pros:**

  * Maximizes efficiency.
  * Focuses only on what’s truly important for the customer.
* **Cons:**

  * Requires strong team discipline.
  * Hard to apply in very large, complex projects.
* **Example:** A **startup building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** – instead of making every feature at once, they launch the core feature first (like ride-booking in Uber), then add extras later.

## 4️⃣ Scrum (Agile Framework)

* **Definition:** Scrum is a **framework under Agile** used to manage work in **sprints**.
* **How it works:**

  * Work is divided into sprints (2–4 weeks).
  * Each sprint delivers a **potentially shippable product increment**.
  * Daily short meetings (Daily Scrum) help track progress.
* **Roles:**

  * **Product Owner** → Defines product backlog (features list).
  * **Scrum Master** → Facilitates process, removes blockers.
  * **Development Team** → Builds the product.
* **Events:**

  * Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
* **Pros:**

  * Strong team collaboration.
  * Regular customer feedback.
  * Clear roles and responsibilities.
* **Cons:**

  * Needs experienced teams.
  * Requires commitment from all stakeholders.
* **Example:** A **mobile app development team** working on a fitness app, delivering features like login, workout tracker, and nutrition planner in different sprints.
