# 📘 **SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle**

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a **step-by-step process** that defines how software is **planned, developed, tested, deployed, and maintained**.

It ensures software is built in a **structured, efficient, and high-quality way**.

## 🛠️ **Phases of SDLC**

1. **Requirement Analysis 📋**

   * Understand what the customer needs.
   * Collect requirements (functional & non-functional).
   * Output → *Software Requirement Specification (SRS)*.

2. **Planning 🗂️**

   * Define scope, cost, and timelines.
   * Identify risks and resources.
   * Output → *Project Plan*.

3. **Design 🎨**

   * Create architecture (high-level & low-level designs).
   * Decide database structure, UI/UX, workflows.
   * Output → *Design Document*.

4. **Development (Coding) 💻**

   * Actual code is written by developers.
   * Follows coding standards and guidelines.
   * Output → *Source Code*.

5. **Testing ✅**

   * Test the application for bugs & quality issues.
   * Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, User Acceptance Testing.
   * Output → *Test Reports*.

6. **Deployment 🚀**

   * Release the software into production (live environment).
   * Can be **manual** or **automated (CI/CD pipelines)**.
   * Output → *Running Application*.

7. **Maintenance 🔧**

   * Fix bugs, update features, security patches.
   * Continuous monitoring and support.
   * Output → *Stable & Updated Software*.

## 🔄 **Popular SDLC Models**

* **Waterfall Model** – Linear, step-by-step approach.
* **Agile Model** – Iterative, flexible, frequent releases.
* **Scrum** – Agile framework using sprints.
* **Lean** – Focus on efficiency and minimizing waste.
* **DevOps** – Continuous development, testing, and deployment.

👉 In your **DevOps course**, SDLC is the **foundation**, and DevOps improves it by automating **development, testing, deployment, and monitoring** for faster delivery.

Would you like me to also create a **visual diagram of SDLC phases** (like a cycle) so it’s easy for students to remember?
